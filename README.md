Root for StrykerSKS SmartThings development.\

Looking for the Ecobee 3 device type? Then don't clone here... instead, you really want to use these:
https://github.com/StrykerSKS/SmartThingsPublic/tree/StrykerSKS-Ecobee3/devicetypes/smartthings/ecobee-thermostat.src

https://github.com/StrykerSKS/SmartThingsPublic/tree/StrykerSKS-Ecobee3/devicetypes/smartthings/ecobee-sensor.src

https://github.com/StrykerSKS/SmartThingsPublic/tree/StrykerSKS-Ecobee3/smartapps/smartthings/ecobee-connect.src


And I'm working on different branches at the moment, but the most stable one is likely: StrykerSKS-Ecobee3

My hope is to get this integrated back into the main SmartThings tree so it will be more easily accessible to everyone.
